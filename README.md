## Features
- Responds with "‡¶®‡¶Æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞" (Hello) when you send the "Hi" command in Slack.
- Easily extensible for more custom commands.
- Integration with Slack API using [github.com/shomali11/slacker](https://github.com/shomali11/slacker).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GoLang 1.21.0 or later installed.
- A Slack bot token and app token. You can obtain these from your Slack workspace.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samriddha-basu-cloud/slack-bot.git
   cd slack-bot
   ```

2. Set your Slack bot and app tokens as environment variables:
   ```bash
   export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
   export SLACK_APP_TOKEN=your_app_token
   ```

3. Build and run the bot:
   ```bash
   go build
   ./slack-bot
   ```

## Usage
Once the bot is up and running, you can interact with it on Slack. For example, if you send the "Hi" command, the bot will reply with "‡¶®‡¶Æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞" (Hello).

## Extending the Bot
You can extend this bot to perform various tasks, such as fetching weather information or answering questions using AI APIs. To do so:
- Add new command definitions to the `main` function, similar to the "Hi" command.
- Implement the desired functionality within the command's handler function.
